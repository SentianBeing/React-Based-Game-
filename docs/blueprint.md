## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Retro blue (#5DADE2) for the sky and general optimistic tone.
- Background color: Desaturated retro blue (#D2EAF4). This color is the same hue as the primary color, but its saturation is heavily reduced to about 20% to ensure it does not draw the eye.
- Accent color: Analogous teal green (#48C9B0), offset about 30 degrees on the color wheel, for collectible objects.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif with a computerized, techy, scientific feel that evokes a sense of retro-futurism appropriate to the era.
- Pixel art icons in a retro style. Simple, clear, and thematically relevant to the fantasy setting.
- 2D side-scrolling perspective, with level design elements reminiscent of classic platformers.
- 8-bit style animations for character movement, enemy actions, and environment interactions.
